Data Science Project: Grocery Store Analysis with Shiny:

This project, developed collaboratively by a team of computer and data science students at Alexandria University, focuses on analyzing grocery store transaction data using interactive visualizations.

Overview:

The project utilizes Shiny, a web application framework in R, to create an interactive interface for exploring and analyzing the dataset. It includes functionalities for visualizing payment types, age-related spending, city-wise spending, and implements the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining and K-means clustering for customer segmentation based on spending behavior.
